### What I learned

This is my second solution for a challenge from FrontEndMentor.io. I decided to
use SCSS to modularize my CSS and break it up into components for readability and
maintainability. I also incorporated a library called Currency.js to facilitate
currency arithmatic.

### Useful resources

- [Currency JS](https://currency.js.org/) - Arithmatic with currency is difficult when using
  javascript. There are things to consider such as how to represent cents. Unfortunetly,
  representing cents with floating point numbers isn't enough. If done so that way, you may
  end up losing or incrementing cents when rounding up. Currency.js helps take care of this issue.
  It allows you to do currency arithmatic as well as easily output the result in the desired format you want.
